# Problem Statement:
Located in the African country of Côte d’Ivoire, Taï National Park consists of 330,000 hectares of the last remaining West African tropical forest (1).  Recognized as a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site since 1982, it has been the victim of timber logging, poaching, illegal gold mining, as well as cocoa and coffee farming for decades (2).  These disturbances have affected not only the park’s flora, but also its fauna, which includes several endangered species (3).  Conservationists at the Wild Chimpanzee Foundation and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology have installed camera traps that are triggered by heat or motion throughout the park in an effort to track seven types of animal species for conservation efforts.  Our team was tasked with aiding the conservation researchers’ efforts to study the population and distribution of these species in the park by developing a model capable of classifying which species each of the camera traps’ images captured.  Some images taken by the camera traps did not contain an animal, and our team sought to ensure the model would classify these as blank.  The seven species groups the conservationists are interested in studying are: antelope/duiker, bird, civet/genet, hog, leopard, monkey/prosimian, and rodent.  

For each species, look into:
How we expected them to show up in images (nocturnal?)
Civets have spots similar to leopards
How human disturbances are affecting them?

The park is home to several antelope and duiker species, both of which belong to the Bovidae family (5).  Most of these species are diurnal, with the bay duiker being a notable exception (6).  As such, we expected the majority of the images that captured this species group to have been taken during the day.

The park is also within the range of a few hog species.

One species of leopard, Panthera pardus pardus, calls the park home (4, 7).

As in every African rainforest, monkeys and their prosimian cousins can be found in Taï National Park. https://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/16335/excerpt/9780521816335_excerpt.htm

Finally, several species of rodent can be found throughout the park.
